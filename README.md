# Overview
The focus of this study is to explore that how student’s academic performance in primary schools differs due to several parental factors and the factors relevant to the school. It aims to the analyze the extent to which students' achievement can be attributed to teachers and if so, then which characteristics are of highest importance. In order to reveal further insights about how the learning outcomes differ across different types of schools, it delves into the area of public vs private schools and shows how policies can be structured to improve education quality. For this purpose we have formulated the following preliminary research questions.
1.	Which parental factors influence the academic performance of children?
2.	Do teachers have an impact on student performance? If so, which characteristics contribute the most towards better scores? Can a child’s future performance be predicted based on these factors?
3.	Are there any differences in learning outcomes across schools? If so, what are the factors that contribute towards this variation?

In the research, **unsupervised learning** techniques involving **association rules** and **cluster analysis** were used to show that there are several characteristics of teachers as well as parents which play a huge role in improving learning outcomes of children. The results of both methods were consistent which gave me the confidence to employ **supervised learning techniques** such as **decision trees **and **logistic regression** to predict the students performance given the important characteristics that had been identified.
